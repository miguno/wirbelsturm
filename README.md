# Wirbelsturm

Wirbelsturm is a [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) based tool to perform
1-click local and remote deployments, with a focus on big data related infrastructure.

**Wirbelsturm's goal is to make tasks such as "I want to deploy a multi-node Storm cluster" _simple_, _easy_, and**
**_fun_**.

It has been called the "Cluster Vagrant" and "Big Data Vagrant" by some of its users, albeit in our opinion that makes
Wirbelsturm appear to be more than it really is, and it doesn't give enough [credit](#credits) to the tools on which it
is based.

Its direct value proposition is two-fold:

1. ***Provide a working integration of [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/).***
   Vagrant is used to create and manage machines, Puppet is used for provisioning those machines (e.g. to install and
   configure software packages).  Because Wirbelsturm uses Vagrant you can basically deploy to any target platform
   that Vagrant supports -- local VMs, AWS, OpenStack, etc. -- although Wirbelsturm does not support all of those out
   of the box yet.  While Wirbelsturm's Puppet setup is slightly opinionated with its preference for
   [Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/) and with its notion of _environments_ and _roles_, these conventions
   should help to jumpstart new users and, of course, you can change this behavior if needed.
2. ***Add a thin wrapper layer around Vagrant to simplify deploying multiple machines of the same kind.***
   This is very helpful when deploying software such as [Storm](http://storm.apache.org/),
   [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) and [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) clusters, where most of the machines look
   the same.  In native Vagrant you would be required to (say) manually maintain 30 configuration sections in
   `Vagrantfile` for deploying 30 Storm slave nodes, even though only their hostnames and IP addresses would change from
   one to the next.

There is also an indirect, third value proposition:

* Because we happen to maintain Wirbelsturm-compatible Puppet modules such as
  [puppet-kafka](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-kafka), [puppet-graphite](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-graphite),
  and [puppet-storm](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-storm), you can benefit from Wirbelsturm's ease of use to
  conveniently deploy those software packages.  As you may have noticed most of these Puppet modules are related to
  large-scale data processing infrastructure and to DevOps tools for operating and monitoring such infrastructures, all
  of which are based on free and open source software.  See [Supported Puppet modules](#supported-puppet-modules) for
  details.

We hope you find Wirbelsturm [as useful as we do](#is-it-for-me).  And most importantly, **have fun!**

# Quick start (local Storm cluster)

Assuming you are using a reasonably powerful computer and have already installed [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
(1.6.1+) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) you can launch a multi-node
[Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) cluster on your local machine with the following commands.  This
Storm cluster is the default configuration example that ships with Wirbelsturm.  Note that the `bootstrap` command
needs to be run only once, after a fresh checkout.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/miguno/wirbelsturm.git
$ cd wirbelsturm
$ ./bootstrap     # <<< May take a while depending on how fast your Internet connection is.
$ vagrant up      # <<< ...and this step also depends on how powerful your computer is.
```

Done -- you now have a fully functioning Storm cluster up and running on your computer!  The deployment should have
taken you less time and effort than brewing yourself an espresso. :-)

Let's take a look at which virtual machines back this cluster behind the scenes:

```
$ vagrant status
Current machine states:

zookeeper1                running (virtualbox)
nimbus1                   running (virtualbox)
supervisor1               running (virtualbox)
supervisor2               running (virtualbox)
```

Storm also ships with a web UI that shows you the cluster's state, e.g. how many nodes it has, whether any processing
jobs (topologies) are being executed, etc.  Wait 20-30 seconds after the deployment is done and then open the Storm UI
at [http://localhost:28080/](http://localhost:28080/).

What's more, Wirbelsturm also allows you to use [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) to interact with the deployed
machines via our [ansible](ansible) wrapper script:

```
$ ./ansible all -m ping
zookeeper1 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

supervisor1 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

nimbus1 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

supervisor2 | success >> {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

Want to run more Storm slaves?  As long as your computer has enough horsepower you only need to change a single number
in `wirbelsturm.yaml`:

```yaml
# wirbelsturm.yaml
nodes:
  ...
  storm_slave:
      count: 2     # <<< changing 2 to 4 is all it takes
  ...
```

Then run `vagrant up` again and shortly after `supervisor3` and `supervisor4` will be up and running.

Want to run a [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) broker?  Uncomment the `kafka_broker` section in your
`wirbelsturm.yaml` (only remove the leading `#` characters, do not remove any whitespace) then run `vagrant up kafka1`.

Once you have finished playing around, you can stop the cluster again by executing `vagrant destroy`.

Note that running a small, local Storm cluster is just the default example.  You can do much more with Wirbelsturm than
this.


<a name="features"></a>

# Features

* **Launching machines:**  Wirbelsturm uses Vagrant to launch the machines that make up your infrastructure
    as VMs running locally in VirtualBox (default) or remotely in Amazon AWS/EC2 (OpenStack support is in the works).
* **Provisioning machines:**  Machines are provisioned via Puppet.
    * Wirbelsturm uses a master-less Puppet setup, i.e. provisioning is ultimately performed through `puppet apply`.
    * Puppet modules are managed via [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet).
* **(Some) batteries included:**  We maintain a number of standard Puppet modules that work well with Wirbelsturm, some
  of which are included in the default configuration of Wirbelsturm.  However you can use any Puppet module with
  Wirbelsturm, of course.  See [Supported Puppet modules](#supported-puppet-modules) for more information.
* **Ansible support:** The [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) aficionados amongst us can use Ansible to interact with
  machines once deployed through Wirbelsturm and Puppet.
* **Host operating system support:** Wirbelsturm has been tested with Mac OS X 10.8+ and RHEL/CentOS 6 as host machines.
  Debian/Ubuntu should work, too.
* **Guest operating system support:** The target OS version for deployed machines is RHEL/CentOS 6 (64-bit).  Amazon
  Linux is supported, too.
    * For local deployments (via VirtualBox) and AWS deployments Wirbelsturm uses a
      [CentOS 6 box created by PuppetLabs](http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/).
    * Switching to RHEL 6 only requires specifying a different [Vagrant box](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html)
      in [bootstrap](bootstrap) (for VirtualBox) or a different AMI image in `wirbelsturm.yaml` (for Amazon
      AWS).
* **When using tools other than Vagrant to launch machines:**  Wirbelsturm-compatible Puppet modules are standard Puppet
  modules, so of course they can be used standalone, too.  This way you can deploy against bare metal machines even if
  you are not able to or do not want to run Wirbelsturm and/or Vagrant directly.
  See [Wirbelsturm-less deployment](docs/Wirbelsturm-less_deployment.md) documentation for details.


<a name="is-it-for-me"></a>

# Is Wirbelsturm for me?

Here are some ideas for what you can do with Wirbelsturm:

* Evaluate new technologies such as Kafka and Storm in a temporary environment that you can set up and tear
  down at will. Without having to spend hours and stay late figuring out how to install those tools.
  Then tell your boss how hard you worked for it.
* Provide your teams with a consistent look and feel of infrastructure environments from initial prototyping
  to development & testing and all the way to production.  Banish "But it does work fine on _my_ machine!" remarks
  from your daily standups.  Well, hopefully.
* Save money if (at least some of) these environments run locally instead of in an IAAS cloud or on bare-metal
  machines that you would need to purchase first.  Make Finance happy for the first time.
* Create production-like environments for training classes.  Use them to get new hires up to speed.  Or unleash a
  [Chaos Monkey](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html) and check how well your
  applications, DevOps tools, or technical staff can handle the mess.  Bring coke and popcorn.
* Create sandbox environments to demo your product to customers.  If Sales can run it, so can they.
* Develop and test-drive your or other people's Puppet modules.  But see also
  [beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) and [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) if your focus is on
  testing.

Let us know how _you_ are using Wirbelsturm!


<a name="default-configuration"></a>

# Default configuration

_The default configuration is what you get when you run `vagrant up` or `./deploy` without any config customizations,_
_e.g. after a fresh checkout._

The purpose of the default configuration is to provide you with a simple yet non-trivial (local) deployment example that
will work out of the box on a reasonably modern computer.  For that purpose we opted to create a default configuration
which will deploy a functional, multi-node Storm cluster that runs as multiple virtual machines locally.

The default cluster setup defined in [wirbelsturm.yaml.template](wirbelsturm.yaml.template) consists of
four virtual machines:

* 1 ZooKeeper server
* 1 Storm master node running Nimbus and Storm UI daemons
* 2 Storm slave nodes, each running two Storm Supervisor daemons for a total of 4 "slots" aka worker processes

The machines are aptly named:

    zookeeper1
    nimbus1
    supervisor1
    supervisor2

The default Java version in Wirbelsturm is OpenJDK 7.  That means, for instance, that you must compile your own (Kafka,
Storm, Hadoop, ...) code with Java 7, too.  If needed you can change the JDK package via the Puppet class parameter
`$java_package_name` of [puppet-wirbelsturm_common](https://github.com/miguno/puppet-wirbelsturm_common).  Here is how
to do this via Hiera (the example below modifies [common.yaml](puppet/manifests/hieradata/common.yaml)):

```yaml
---
classes:
  - wirbelsturm_common

# The config value must match the (RPM) package name of the desired JRE/JDK version
wirbelsturm_common::java_package_name: 'java-1.7.0-sun'
```

_Important: When deploying Storm in production it is recommended to use Oracle JRE/JDK 7 instead of OpenJDK 7._

The default configuration sets the Java heap size of the various Storm processes (Nimbus, UI, Supervisor, worker
processes) to 256MB each.  This is enough to play around with Storm but of course not sufficient to perform large-scale
data processing.  Make sure you use a powerful host machine and a customized configuration (see below) if you want to do
more.

Note: In most cases changes to the configurations of Storm, Kafka, ZooKeeper etc. will automatically trigger a restart
of the respective processes once you re-deploy.


<a name="getting-started"></a>

# Getting started

This section brings you up to speed from zero to a running cluster.  Here, we will show how to use the default cluster
configuration of Wirbelsturm to deploy a Storm cluster locally on your host machine (e.g. your laptop).  If you are
deploying Wirbelsturm remotely -- such as on Amazon AWS -- the instructions are very similar.  In the latter cases
you should first read the respective sections (e.g. on deploying to AWS) further down in this document and then come
back to this section because Wirbelsturm works 99% in the same way no matter to where you deploy.


<a name="install-prerequisites"></a>

## Install prerequisites

Wirbelsturm depends on the following software packages _on the host machine from which you run Wirbelsturm_, i.e. the
machine on which you execute commands such as `vagrant up`.  So if you are running Wirbelsturm on your laptop, you must
install those packages on that laptop.

1. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) 1.6.1+
2. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) 4.3.x
3. Optional: [GNU parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/), only needed if you want to benefit from parallel
   provisioning via our [deploy](deploy) script to speed up deployments

Preferably Mac OS X users should also:

* have a working [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) setup
* have [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) as their default shell


### Install Vagrant

* [Download version 1.6.3 of Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) for your OS and install accordingly.

Verify the installation of Vagrant:

```shell
$ vagrant -v
Vagrant version 1.6.3
```

**Note for Mac OS X users:** To uninstall Vagrant run the `uninstall.tool` script that is included in the `.dmg` file.


### Install VirtualBox

* [Download a VirtualBox 4.3.x platform package](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for your OS and install
  accordingly.

**Note for Mac OS X users:**  To uninstall VirtualBox run the `VirtualBox_Uninstall.tool` script that is included in the
`.dmg` file.


### Install GNU parallel (optional)

_You only need to install GNU parallel if you like to start your clusters via [deploy](deploy) to benefit from parallel
and thus faster provisioning.  If you do not you can safely omit the installation of GNU parallel._

Install `parallel` on the _host_ machine:

```shell
# Mac
# - Homebrew
$ brew install parallel
# - MacPorts
$ sudo port install parallel

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
$ sudo yum install parallel
$ sudo vi /etc/parallel/config  # and change '--tollef' to '--gnu'

# Debian/Ubuntu
$ sudo apt-get install parallel # requires Ubuntu 13.04; earlier versions may work, too
$ sudo vi /etc/parallel/config  # and change '--tollef' to '--gnu'
```


<a name="install-wirbelsturm"></a>

## Install Wirbelsturm

Clone this repository and then bootstrap Wirbelsturm:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/miguno/wirbelsturm.git
$ cd wirbelsturm
$ ./bootstrap     # <<< May take a while depending on how fast your Internet connection is.
```

The bootstrapping step will prepare the local environment of your host machine so that it can properly run Wirbelsturm.
This includes, for instance, installing a compatible version of Ruby via rvm, required Ruby gems, Vagrant plugins and
Vagrant boxes, as well as any Puppet modules that are included in Wirbelsturm out of the box (see
[Puppetfile](puppet/Puppetfile)).

Advanced users also have the option to skip the Ruby-related part of the bootstrapping process, e.g. if you prefer to
stick to a different Ruby version.  Here, replace the `./bootstrap` command above with a sequence such as:

```shell
$ bundle install
$ ./bootstrap --skip-ruby
```

The bootstrapping step will also create a `wirbelsturm.yaml` from the included
[wirbelsturm.yaml.template](wirbelsturm.yaml.template).  This YAML configuration file controls which machines will be
launched and what their configuration will be.


<a name="usage"></a>

# Usage


<a name="deploying"></a>

## Performing a deployment

_This section uses the default configuration of Wirbelsturm as a running example._

To perform a local deployment on your host machine with the default settings you only need to run one of the
following two commands:

```shell
# Option 1: Deploy with sequential provisioning, using native Vagrant
#           (You must use this if you haven't installed the `parallel` tool)
$ vagrant up

# Option 2: Deploy with parallel provisioning (faster).
#           Logs are stored under `provisioning-logs/`.
$ ./deploy
```

The `deploy` script is a simple wrapper for `vagrant up`.  In contrast to the standard `vagrant up` behavior
it will speed up the deployment by running the _provisioning step_ in parallel.  The script will launch the cluster in
two distinct phases:

1. First, it will boot the virtual machines (but not provision them yet).  When deploying locally via VirtualBox this
   step will _sequentially_ boot the VMs.  Other providers such as AWS support launching machines in parallel.
2. Once all VMs are running it will then trigger provisioning (via Puppet) in parallel.

The script stores per-node provisioning log files under `provisioning-logs/`.  Existing log files are purged when you
re-run `deploy`.

_Tip: You can also re-run `deploy` if you just want to re-provision the cluster in parallel (e.g. because_
_you changed a single configuration file) without destroying/recreating the virtual machines from scratch.  This saves_
_you a lot of time because recreating the VMs usually takes several minutes per VM._

Feel free to run `vagrant status` while Vagrant is doing its magic to see which virtual machines are already running.
Note that the "running" state of a VM only means that it is booted -- it does not necessarily mean it has already been
fully provisioned.

You can also instruct Wirbelsturm/Vagrant to use a file other than the default `wirbelsturm.yaml`.  You only need to
set the `WIRBELSTURM_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable appropriately:

    # Examples
    $ WIRBELSTURM_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/your/custom-wirbelsturm.yaml ./deploy
    $ WIRBELSTURM_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/your/custom-wirbelsturm.yaml vagrant status


<a name="access"></a>

## Accessing deployed machines

Once the machines are up and running you can `vagrant ssh <hostname>` into them.  You can get the list of available
hostnames via `vagrant status`.

By default the `vagrant ssh` command will connect as the user `vagrant`.  This user has password-less sudo enabled so
that you can run privileged commands, install software, switch user ids, perform manual service restarts, etc.

```shell
# Example: ssh-connect to the nimbus1 machine
$ vagrant ssh nimbus1
```

You can also configure SSH port forwarding to access services that run on the deployed machines.  The default
configuration of Wirbelsturm allows you to access the Storm UI running on `nimbus1` with your browser.  Note that it
might take up to a minute after provisioning is complete (e.g. after `./deploy` finishes) until the Storm UI is ready
to use.  If in doubt just hit the reload button in your browser until it works. :-)

* [http://localhost:28080/](http://localhost:28080/) -- Storm UI

The UI should provide you with a screen similar to the following.  In this screenshot you can also see that there is
one running topology called "exclamation-topology" (which will not be the case after a fresh restart of the cluster).
In the section _Submitting an example Storm topology_ I will walk you through submitting this topology to the cluster.

![Storm UI Home Page](images/wirbelsturm_storm-ui-home.png?raw=true)

You can follow the section [Submitting an example Storm topology](#appendix-storm-topology) in the appendix to run your
first hands-on data analysis with Storm.


<a name="shutdown"></a>

## Shutting down the deployed environment

To take down the deployed machines you need to run:

```shell
# Will ask for confirmation for each machine
$ vagrant destroy

# Will take down machines without asking for any confirmation
$ vagrant destroy -f
```

Please refer to the [Vagrant documentation](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/puppet_apply.html) for further
details on how to work with Vagrant, notably its [command-line interface](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/index.html)
`vagrant`.


<a name="ansible"></a>

## Ansible support

### Ansible and Wirbelsturm

Wirbelsturm supports [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) to interact with deployed machines.  Note however that
Wirbelsturm uses Puppet -- not Ansible -- for provisioning the machines launched by Vagrant.  Wirbelsturm ships with
an Ansible wrapper script aptly named [ansible](ansible) that pre-configures several Ansible settings (such as
generating a [dynamic inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_dynamic_inventory.html) of running machines by querying
Vagrant) so that Ansible works out of the box with Wirbelsturm/Vagrant.


### Examples

Ansible will only see _running_ machines, i.e. those reported by `vagrant status` as `running`.  So before trying to
play with Ansible make sure that you have at least one machine up and running.

Here are some examples on how to use Ansible with Wirbelsturm's [ansible](ansible) wrapper script.

    # Show all running boxes
    $ ./ansible all --list-hosts

    # Ping all running boxes
    $ ./ansible all -m ping

    # Install 'tree' on the nimbus1 box
    $ ./ansible nimbus1 -m shell -a 'yum install -y tree' --sudo

    # Check the status of processes running under supervisord on all machines
    $ ./ansible all -m shell -a 'supervisorctl status' --sudo


<a name="configuration"></a>

# Configuration

Now that you have played with Wirbelsturm and its default configuration you may want to create your own configuration.
In this section we will explain how to do just that.

Before we start let us highlight that most of the "requirements" or "conventions" discussed below are in fact not
specific to Wirbelsturm.  They are simply driven by the way Vagrant and Puppet/Hiera work.  As such the sections below
are also a kind of quick introduction to the aforementioned tools and their usage.  Lastly, if you are already familiar
with Vagrant and/or Puppet there should be nothing in the next sections that will surprise you.


<a name="cfg-big-picture"></a>

## The big picture

There are three key places in Wirbelsturm that you need to customize for your own deployments.

1. **Defining which machines will be created**:
   The file `wirbelsturm.yaml` (see [wirbelsturm.yaml.template](wirbelsturm.yaml.template)) controls the
   creation of the machines in your deployment environment.  Here, you define the name of your environment, how
   many machines will be launched, what their hostnames and "roles" are, etc.  This information is subsequently used by
   Puppet and Hiera to determine which Puppet manifests and Hiera configuration data will be applied to each machine.
   `wirbelsturm.yaml` is automatically read by Vagrant when you run e.g.  `vagrant status` or `vagrant up`.  Note that
   `wirbelsturm.yaml` _is not used_ of course when you are not using Wirbelsturm (and thus Vagrant) to launch your
   machines -- for instance, if you deploy to existing bare-metal machines.
2. **Defining which Puppet modules you require**:
   Like many other Puppet-based setups Wirbelsturm uses [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet)
   to manage the Puppet modules that are used for your deployments (similar to how tools such as Maven or Gradle manage
   library dependencies in Java).  `librarian-puppet` takes over the control of the `puppet/modules/` directory.  So
   if you need additional Puppet modules for your deployments, different versions of existing ones, or remove
   modules, you only need to update [puppet/Puppetfile](puppet/Puppetfile) and then tell `librarian-puppet` to update
   the modules under `puppet/modules/` via commands such as `librarian-puppet update` or
   `librarian-puppet update <module-name>` (you must run `librarian-puppet` in the `puppet/` sub-directory).
3. **Defining configuration data for Puppet via Hiera**:
   Wirbelsturm performs the provisioning of machines in your deployment through Puppet.  And a Puppet best practice is
   to create or use Puppet modules that support configuration through Hiera.  Roughly speaking, this means that a Puppet
   module must expose all relevant configuration settings through Puppet class parameters.  The Hiera hierarchy of
   Wirbelsturm is defined in [puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml](puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml), and the actual Hiera
   configuration data is stored under [puppet/manifests/hieradata/](puppet/manifests/hieradata).  Please take a look at
   the existing content in those two places to get started with Hiera in Wirbelsturm.  If you are familiar with Hiera
   you should notice that Wirbelsturm uses a straight-forward, typical Hiera setup.

In the next sections we discuss these three key places, and thereby machine creation and provisioning, in further
detail.


<a name="cfg-machine-creation"></a>

## Defining which machines will be created

The cluster machines are defined in `wirbelsturm.yaml`.  See
[wirbelsturm.yaml.template](wirbelsturm.yaml.template) for an example.

[Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) is set up to dynamically read the information in `wirbelsturm.yaml` to configure and launch
the virtual machines.

We want to highlight the following parameters in particular, because they influence the subsequent _provisioning_ of the
machines via Puppet:

* The `environment` parameter in `wirbelsturm.yaml`:  The value of this parameter is made available to Puppet and
  Hiera as the Puppet fact `node_env`.  So if you set `environment: foo`, for instance, then Wirbelsturm will
  automatically inject the Puppet fact `node_env = 'foo'` into your machines.
* The `node_role` parameter:  The value of this parameter is made available to Puppet and Hiera as the Puppet fact
  `node_role`.
* The `hostname_prefix` and `count` parameters:  These two parameters determine the hostname of a machine.  If, for
  instance, `hostname_prefix: supervisor` and `count: 3`, then Wirbelsturm will launch three such machines and give them
  the respective hostnames `supervisor1`, `supervisor2`, and `supervisor3`.  The hostnames are made available to Puppet
  as the Puppet fact `hostname`.

The environment name as well as the hostnames of machines are important parameters because you can use them to determine
which Puppet manifests should be applied to a machine -- see [hiera.yaml](puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml).

<a name="cfg-provisioning"></a>

## Provisioning

Wirbelsturm relies on Puppet and Hiera for provisioning.  As such the entry points for understanding provisioning are:

* [hiera.yaml](puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml) -- defines the Hiera hierarchy
* [hieradata/](puppet/manifests/hieradata/) -- the actual Hiera configuration data
* [site.pp](puppet/manifests/site.pp) -- how we control our use of Hiera in Puppet
* [Puppetfile](puppet/Puppetfile) -- the collection of Puppet modules used for a deployment;  managed through
  [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet)

_Machine creation settings must match provisioning settings:_
When using Wirbelsturm/Vagrant for machine creation -- i.e. launching machines and such -- then what is defined in Hiera
must match what is defined in `wirbelsturm.yaml`;  otherwise the machines will be launched (via Vagrant) but not
properly installed and configured (via Puppet) once up and running.

_Puppet modules should be configurable through Hiera:_
In Wirbelsturm it is strongly recommended that all Puppet modules that are used for a deployment (see
[Puppetfile](puppet/Puppetfile)) expose any relevant configuration settings through Puppet class parameters.  Otherwise
you cannot use Hiera to inject configuration data into the Puppet manifests, and instead you must hardcode configuration
data into your Puppet manifest code.  We've been there, done that, realized it didn't work well or at all.  Don't make
the same mistake we did.

_Informing Puppet how configuration data is made available to Puppet manifests via Hiera:_
Wirbelsturm currently relies on three Puppet facts to determine which Puppet manifests should be applied to a machine:

* `node_env`: The name of the deployment _environment_ (e.g. `default-environment`).  This Puppet fact can be used to
  group settings that are shared across a deployment environment.  See also the previous section on machine creation.
* `node_role`: The _role_ of the machine (e.g. `kafka_broker`).  See also the previous section on machine creation.
* `hostname`: The hostname of the machine (e.g. `supervisor1`).  This is the hostname of the machine as returned by
  standard Unix commands such as `hostname`.  See also the previous section on machine creation.

See [hiera.yaml](puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml) for the exact definition how those facts are used to determine which
Hiera configuration data and thereby also which Puppet manifests should be applied to a machine.

We cover _environments_ and _roles_ in the next sections in further detail, and how they can be mixed and matched.

### Defining which Puppet modules you require

In Wirbelsturm you manage the collection of Puppet modules you require for your deployment through the popular Puppet
tool [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet).  In concrete terms that means you will add (or
remove) any required modules to [Puppetfile](puppet/Puppetfile).  Once you have added, changed, or removed modules,
you must tell librarian-puppet to update its configuration.

Here is an example workflow:

    $ cd puppet/               # change to the puppet/ subfolder
    $ vi Puppetfile            # add/modify/remove modules
    $ librarian-puppet update  # MUST be run from inside the puppet/ subfolder!

That's all!

See [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) for more information.


<a name="cfg-hiera"></a>

### Defining configuration data for Puppet via Hiera

#### Environments

Wirbelsturm has the notion of "deployment environments".  These environments are nothing fancy, they are simply a
name and used to define settings that are shared across a number of machines in the same physical location or logical
environment.  For instance, "every machine in our `storm-production-nyc` environment should talk to _this_ ZooKeeper
quorum".

An environment can have multiple machines, but a machine can be assigned to _only one environment_.

* Defining environments:  Environments are defined by creating a Hiera YAML file at
  `environments/<environment-name>.yaml` (cf.  [environments/](puppet/manifests/hieradata/environments/)).
* Assigning machines to environments:  You assign a machine to an environment by providing the Puppet fact `node_env` to
  the machine.  In Wirbelsturm this is done by setting the `environment` parameter in `wirbelsturm.yaml`.
* Resolving environments:  The names of environment Hiera YAML files under `environments/` are matched against the
  `node_env` Puppet fact.  Vagrant injects this variable as a custom Puppet fact into the machine via
  `FACTER_node_env=...`.  Unfortunately this custom fact is not persisted to the machine, e.g. you will not see it when
  you manually run `facter` inside the machine.
    * Example: If `node_env` is `storm-production-nyc`, then we look for a file
      `environments/storm-production-nyc.yaml`.

The Hiera settings in the environment file are applied to each machine that is assigned to that environment.

Wirbelsturm ships with only one environment, the `default-environment`:

* [default-environment](puppet/manifests/hieradata/environments/default-environment.yaml)

You can easily create your own environments by following this example and standard Puppet/Hiera practices.

For each machine you can also override the default environment settings through per-host Hiera YAML files
at `environments/<environment-name>/hosts/<hostname>.yaml`.

* Example: `environments/storm-production-nyc/hosts/storm-slave-21.yaml`


#### Roles

You can (and normally should) assign every machine a _role_.  Roles are used to define settings that are shared among
machines of the _same kind_.  For instance, every Kafka broker (= the machine's role) should normally look the same,
regardless of whether it's deployed in Europe or in the US (= environment/location).  This is thus also the difference
between _environments_ and _roles_ -- they have similar but distinct purposes.

_Only one role_ can ever be assigned to a machine.  If a machine should have multiple roles, then you can work around
this restriction by creating a compound role -- e.g. by combining the logical roles `webserver` and `monitoring` into a
compound role `webserver_with_monitoring`.

* Defining roles: Roles are defined by creating a Hiera YAML file at `roles/<role>.yaml` (cf.
  [roles/](puppet/manifests/hieradata/roles/)).
* Assigning roles to machines: A role is assigned to a machine by providing the Puppet fact `node_role` to the machine.
  In Wirbelsturm this is done by setting the `role` parameter in `wirbelsturm.yaml`.
* Resolving roles:  The names of role Hiera YAML files under `roles/` are matched against the `node_role` Puppet fact.
  Vagrant injects this variable as a custom Puppet fact into the machine via `FACTER_node_role=...`.  Unfortunately
  this custom fact is not persisted to the VM, e.g. you will not see it when you manually run `facter` inside the
  machine.
    * Example: If `node_role` is `kafka_broker`, then we look for a file `roles/kafka_broker.yaml`.

The Hiera settings in the role file are applied to each machine that is assigned to that role.

Wirbelsturm ships with some such roles out of the box (see [hieradata/roles/](puppet/manifests/hieradata/roles/) for
the full list):

* [kafka_broker](puppet/manifests/hieradata/roles/kafka_broker.yaml)
* [redis_server](puppet/manifests/hieradata/roles/redis_server.yaml)
* [storm_master](puppet/manifests/hieradata/roles/storm_master.yaml)
* [storm_slave](puppet/manifests/hieradata/roles/storm_slave.yaml)
* [zookeeper_server](puppet/manifests/hieradata/roles/zookeeper_server.yaml)

You can easily create your own roles by following those examples and standard Puppet/Hiera practices.

For each machine you can also override the default role settings through per-host Hiera YAML files
at `environments/<environment-name>/roles/<role>.yaml`.

* Example: `environments/storm-production-nyc/roles/kafka_broker.yaml`.


#### Combining environments and roles

In a typical Wirbelsturm setup you will usually combine environment-level Hiera settings and role-level Hiera settings.
This way you can compose exactly how machines should be deployed while minimizing duplication of configuration data.

* Example: "All Kafka brokers (= **role**) should normally look like _this_, but in our `kafka-production-nyc`
  **environment** we need a different setting for _that_ particular configuration parameter."

The default Hiera hierarchy definition at [hiera.yaml](puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml) controls how this composition of
data exactly happens -- notably which values override which other values in case a configuration parameter is defined
more than once.  This is standard Hiera 101, by the way, and not specific to Wirbelsturm in any way.

<a name="deploying-locally"></a>

## Local deployment (VMs)

This section covers scenarios where you instruct Wirbelsturm to run its machines locally as VMs on a host machine.
For further information please read the _Usage_ section above.


### Host requirements

The "host" is the machine on which Wirbelsturm will start the virtual Storm cluster, i.e. the machine on which you
run `vagrant up` or `deploy`.

The minimum hardware requirements for running the [default configuration](#default-configuration) are:

* 4 CPU cores
* 8 GB of RAM
* 20 GB of disk space

More is better, of course.


### Telling Wirbelsturm to deploy locally

    # Option 1: Sequential provisioning (native Vagrant)
    $ vagrant up --provider=virtualbox

    # Option 2: Parallel provisioning (Wirbelsturm wrapper script for `vagrant`)
    #           Logs are stored under `provisioning-logs/`.
    $ ./deploy --provider=virtualbox


<a name="wirbelsturm-less-deployment"></a>

## Wirbelsturm-less deployment

Several users have asked how they can re-use their existing Wirbelsturm setup that they created for local development
and testing in order to deploy "real" environments, e.g. backed by a couple of bare-metal machines.  A different but
related use case is situations where you cannot or are not allowed to use Wirbelsturm and/or Vagrant to deploy to
non-local environments (i.e. to anything but your local computer).  Of course, it is up to you then to manage the
machines (booting machines, configuring networking, etc.), which is normally taken care of by Wirbelsturm/Vagrant.

See the [Wirbelsturm-less deployment](docs/Wirbelsturm-less_deployment.md) documentation for details.


<a name="aws"></a>

## Amazon AWS/EC2 (Beta)

Wirbelsturm supports deploying to AWS.  See our current [AWS documentation](docs/AWS.md) for details.

However at this point you still need to perform a few one-time AWS preparation steps.  And because this means our
users do not have the best possible AWS experience we decided to flag AWS support as "beta".  What does "beta" mean
in this context?  It means that it is still possible at this point that we will perform a code refactoring to change
our AWS support for the better -- and thus we may change the way Wirbelsturm users need to configure their AWS
deployments or how they interact with AWS through Wirbelsturm/Vagrant may still change.  Since we first finished the
AWS-related code some time has passed, and several upstream projects such as
[vagrant-aws](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws) have improved during that time.  Also, plugins such as
[vagrant-hostmanager](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager) may allow use to stop using (and thus requiring
you to configure) Amazon Route 53 (but right now `vagrant-hostmanager` is not yet compatible with Vagrant 1.5).

We therefore think that we can further simplify the way you can use Wirbelsturm to deploy to AWS, even though this may
mean we have to redo certain parts of the code, and even break backwards compatibility in some areas.

This section will eventually describe how to deploy to private and public OpenStack clouds.  Code contributions are
welcome!


<a name="supported-puppet-modules"></a>

# Supported Puppet modules

<a name="puppet-wirbelsturm-compatibility"></a>

## When is a Puppet module compatible with Wirbelsturm?

In general any Puppet module is compatible with Wirbelsturm.  Yes, _any_ module.

However we strongly recommend to write or use such Puppet modules that expose their relevant configuration settings
through _class parameters_.  This decouples the module's logic (code/manifests) from its configuration, and thereby
allows you to configure the module's behavior through [Hiera](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/).  This Puppet
recommendation is not specific to Wirbelsturm -- in fact, you will often (always?) want to follow this best practice
every time you write or use a Puppet module for your deployments.

If your favorite Puppet module does not follow this style, you can of course still use it in Wirbelsturm.  However
in this case you will most likely have to fork/modify the module whenever your configuration requirements change.
Or write "adapter" Puppet modules that wrap the original one.  Or...you get the idea.  Whatever workaround you pick it
will usually not make you perfectly happy.  But then again, for tasks such as quick prototyping or when your under
pressure it is acceptable to "just get it done".  Just be aware that most likely you're adding technical debt to your
setup.


<a name="available-puppet-modules"></a>

## Available Puppet modules

The following table shows a _non-comprehensive list_ of Puppet modules that are known to work well with Wirbelsturm,
where "well" means they can be configured through Hiera.  As we said in the previous section _any_ Puppet module can be
used in Wirbelsturm, it just happens that some will make your life easier than others.  So treat the table below merely
as a nice starting point, but not as an exclusive listing.

You will find more Puppet modules on [PuppetForge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

# Known issues and limitations

## ZooKeeper server fails to join quorum because of "UnknownHostException"

_This issue only affects ZK quorum deployments.  Standalone ZK deployments are not affected._

This issue is caused by a known bug in ZooKeeper 3.4+ that, as of October 2014, is not yet fixed:

* [ZOOKEEPER-1848](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1846):
  Cached InetSocketAddresses prevent proper dynamic DNS resolution

Unfortunately this issue is very reliably triggered when using Vagrant (and thus Wirbelsturm) to deploy ZK quorums to
local VMs. :-(

You can quickly test whether your deployment is affected via the following Ansible command, which sends the
[stat](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperAdmin.html#The+Four+Letter+Words) Four Letter Command to all
ZK servers:

    # Here we test whether the machine `zookeeper1` has joined the quorum
    $ ./ansible zookeeper* -m shell -a 'echo stat | nc 127.0.0.1 2181'

A negative "failure" reply includes the string "This ZooKeeper instance is not currently serving requests", which means
the ZK server has not joined the quorum, which typically indicates that it is affected by the ZK issue described here:

    zookeeper3 | success | rc=0 >>
    This ZooKeeper instance is not currently serving requests

In comparison, a positive "success" message looks as follows:

    zookeeper3 | success | rc=0 >>
    Zookeeper version: 3.4.5-cdh4.7.0--1, built on 05/28/2014 16:33 GMT
    Clients:
     /127.0.0.1:48714[0](queued=0,recved=1,sent=0)

    Latency min/avg/max: 0/0/0
    Received: 1
    Sent: 0
    Connections: 1
    Outstanding: 0
    Zxid: 0x100000000
    Mode: follower   # <<< this ZK server has joined the quorum as a follower
    Node count: 4

Another telling sign is `java.net.UnknownHostException` errors in the ZK log files:

    $ ./ansible zookeeper* -m shell -a 'grep java.net.UnknownHostException /var/log/zookeeper/zookeeper.log | tail'
    zookeeper3 | success | rc=0 >>
    java.net.UnknownHostException: zookeeper2

But what is going on here?  This ZK issue is triggered when the ZK process is started at a time when the hostnames of
some ZK quorum members (here: `zookeeper2`) are not resolvable, and due to the ZK bug above (`InetSocketAddress` being
cached forever) the ZK process is not to be able to recover from this condition.

Currently the only remedy is to restart the problematic ZK process, i.e. the one that is complaining about unknown
hosts.  You can use the [ansible](ansible) wrapper script in Wirbelsturm to trigger such restarts:

    # Restart the ZK process on `zookeeper3`
    $ ./ansible zookeeper3 -m shell -a 'supervisorctl restart zookeeper' --sudo

    # Restart the ZK processes on all ZK machines
    $ ./ansible zookeeper* -m shell -a 'supervisorctl restart zookeeper' --sudo

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Wirbelsturm?

"Wirbelsturm" is German for [Whirlwind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlwind), which is a kind of storm.  Originally
we built Wirbelsturm with the sole intent to conveniently deploy Storm clusters, but the name stuck as we moved along.


## Where to start reading the code?

Wirbelsturm is based on Vagrant.  This means the entry point for the code is [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile).  The
Puppet-related provisioning code is in [manifests/](puppet/manifests/) and, with regard to the included Puppet modules,
[Puppetfile](puppet/Puppetfile).  Here you should start reading at [manifests/site.pp](puppet/manifests/site.pp) and
[manifests/hiera.yaml](puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml)..


## Increase logging output of Vagrant?

Set the environment variable `VAGRANT_LOG` accordingly.  Example:

```shell
$ VAGRANT_LOG=debug vagrant up
```

## Share files between the host and the guest machines?

### Option 1: synced folder

To upload or download data you only need to place them in the `shared/` directory (host) and `/shared` directory
(guests aka virtual machines).  Vagrant automatically syncs the contents of these folders.  For instance, if you
create the file `shared/foo` on the host then all the cluster machines can access this file via `/shared/foo`.
Synced files are readable AND writable from all machines.

Note that:

* When using VirtualBox as provider then changes to the synced folder is instantaneous.
* When using AWS as provider then changes to the synced folder require another provisioning run (which triggers rsync).


### Option 2: vagrant-scp.sh

You can use the `scp` wrapper script [vagrant-scp.sh](sh/vagrant-scp.sh) to transfer files between the host machine
and a guest machine (copying directly from guest to guest is not supported).

```shell
# Upload from the host machine to a guest machine
$ sh/vagrant-scp.sh /path/to/file/on/host/foo.txt nimbus1:/tmp

# Download from a guest machine to the host machine
$ sh/vagrant-scp.sh nimbus1:/tmp/bar.txt .
```

## Force shutdown of VirtualBox vm when 'vagrant destroy' fails?

On rare occasions Vagrant may fail to destroy (shutdown) a VirtualBox vm.  The error message will be similar
to:

    There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
    for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

    Command: ["unregistervm", "964f02c5-b368-44c8-840e-f47f90979791", "--delete"]

    Stderr: VBoxManage: error: Cannot unregister the machine 'wirbelsturm_supervisor2_1377594297' while it is locked
    VBoxManage: error: Details: code VBOX_E_INVALID_OBJECT_STATE (0x80bb0007), component Machine, interface IMachine, callee nsISupports

You can force the shutdown by executing the following steps:

1. Kill the VBoxHeadless process of the problematic VirtualBox vm.

        # Find process ID
        $ ps axu | grep VBoxHeadless | grep <vm-hostname>
        $ kill <ID>

2. Then run `vagrant destroy <vm-hostname>`.


# vagrant-hosts does not recognize Vagrant version?

After an upgrade of Vagrant you may see the following error when running `deploy`, `vagrant up` or `vagrant provision`:

    [redis1] Running provisioner: hosts...
    1.3.1 isn't a recognized Vagrant version, vagrant-hosts can't reliably
    detect the `change_host_name` method.

In almost all cases this problem can be solved by installing (updating) the latest version of the `vagrant-hosts`
plugin.

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hosts


## Get EC2 information about a guest machine when deploying to AWS?

Example:

```shell
$ vagrant awsinfo -m nimbus1
```

   Homebrew

        $ brew update
        $ brew tap homebrew/dupes
        $ brew install apple-gcc42

   MacPorts:

        $ sudo port selfupdate
        $ sudo port install apple-gcc42

2. Compile Ruby manually

        $ CC=/opt/local/bin/gcc-apple-4.2 rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p362 --enable-shared --without-tk --without-tcl

3. Re-run `./bootstrap` -- the install should complete successfully now.

You may run into the following error when upgrading from Vagrant 1.4.x to 1.5.x:

    /Applications/Vagrant/embedded/lib/ruby/2.0.0/rubygems/version.rb:191:in `initialize': Malformed version number string aws (ArgumentError)

Most likely this means your Vagrant upgrade did not succeed for some reason.  One indication is that the file
`$HOME/.vagrant.d/setup_version` contains the content `1.5` instead of `1.1\n`.

The following command fixes this problem:

    echo "1.1" > $HOME/.vagrant.d/setup_version

Now you can try re-running Vagrant.  See the discussion at [Can't start my VM on Vagrant 1.5.1](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/3195) for
details.

# How it works

## Main configuration of Wirbelsturm

The main configuration file is `wirbelsturm.yaml` (see [wirbelsturm.yaml.template](wirbelsturm.yaml.template)).
This configuration file defines the various machines, their roles and additional information such as how many of
each you want to deploy.

We introduced the `wirbelsturm.yaml` file to simplify the deployment of many machines of the same type.  For instance,
here's how you can change your deployment to run 30 instead of 2 Storm slave machines:

```yaml
# wirbelsturm.yaml: run 2 Storm slaves
nodes:
  storm_slave:
      count: 2
  ...
```

```yaml
# wirbelsturm.yaml: run 30 Storm slaves
nodes:
  storm_slave:
      count: 30     # <<< changing 2 to 30 is all it takes
  ...
```

In native Vagrant you would have to copy-paste nearly identical configuration sections 30x in `Vagrantfile`, in which
only the hostname and IP address would change.


## Passing Wirbelsturm configuration to Vagrant

We use a custom Ruby module [wirbelsturm.rb](lib/wirbelsturm.rb) that parses the `wirbelsturm.yaml` configuration file
and hands over this data to Vagrant's [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile).  Vagrant will launch the defined machines and will
then use Puppet to provision them once they have booted.


## Masterless and nodeless Puppet setup

Our Puppet setup is _master-less_ (no Puppet Master used) and _node-less_.

One reason to go with a master-less setup was that we have
one less dependency (Puppet Master) to worry about.  Also, going without a Puppet Master means we do not have to scale
or HA the Puppet Master.

The nodeless approach is described at
[puppet-examples/nodeless-puppet](https://github.com/jordansissel/puppet-examples/tree/master/nodeless-puppet/).
"Nodeless" means that we are not making use of Puppet's
[node definitions](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_node_definitions.html), which have the form
`node 'nimbus1' { ... }`.  Instead, Wirbelsturm relies on Puppet's so-called _facts_ to define the _role_ of a
machine (through `wirbelsturm.yaml`) and thus which Puppet code is applied to the machine.  These roles determine
which Puppet manifests and which [Hiera configuration data](puppet/manifests/hiera.yaml) will be applied to a machine
("If machine has the 'webserver', then do X, Y, and Z.").  One benefit of not using node definitions is that we are
not coupling the hostname of machines to their purpose (read: role).

Under the hood we are using Vagrant's feature of adding the required
[custom Puppet facts](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/puppet_apply.html) such as their role and the name of
the deployment environment to the machines.   In the case of deploying to AWS we are also adding the same information
to the EC2 tags of the instances.  This facilitates identifying and working with the instances on the EC2 console.

_Note that you will not see Vagrant-injected custom Puppet facts when you run `facter` on a guest machine.  The_
_custom fact is only available as a variable to the Puppet manifests/modules._


## DNS configuration

Wirbelsturm uses the Vagrant plugin [vagrant-hosts](https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts) to manage DNS settings
configured in `/etc/hosts` on the cluster machines.  This only works for the VirtualBox provider though.  Wirbelsturm
uses a different approach for the DNS configuration ([Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/)) when deploying to
Amazon AWS.


## RPM packages

Puppet works best when software is installed as `.rpm` (RHEL family) or `.deb` (Debian family) packages instead of
(say) tarballs.

Preferably one would use only official software packages, such as those provided by the official RHEL/CentOS
repositories, [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) or binary releases of the upstream software projects.
Unfortunately a number of software projects we want to deploy (e.g. Kafka, Storm) do not provide such RPM packages yet.
For this reason we create our own RPMs where needed, and also release the packaging code (see e.g.
[wirbelsturm-rpm-kafka](https://github.com/miguno/wirbelsturm-rpm-kafka)).

## Yum repositories

We host our custom RPMs, where needed, in a public yum repository for the convenience of Wirbelsturm users.  However we
want to become neither a third-party package maintainer nor a third-party repository, so this practice may likely
change.

We therefore strongly recommend that you manage your own RPM packages and associated yum repositories, particularly
when you are performing production deployments.


<a name="wishlist"></a>

# Wishlist

A non-comprehensive list of features we are still considering to add to Wirbelsturm.

* Puppet:
    * Investigate how we can easily reverse/clean up roles from a machine if a role does not apply anymore
      (cf. [nodeless-puppet](https://github.com/jordansissel/puppet-examples/tree/master/nodeless-puppet/)).
      Most of the work in that regard would need to happen on the side of the actual Puppet modules though.
* Amazon AWS
    * Investigate whether we want to support deployments to Amazon VPC environments, too.
    * Reduce SOA/TTL for Route53 entries to reduce "startup" time for DNS?
        * See [Creating A Records Dynamically, Can't Ping Them](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=298775):
          "Be aware that based on your current SOA record negative responses will be cached for 5 minutes."

## Submitting an example Storm topology

_Note: The instructions below are subject to change._

Once you have a Storm cluster up and running you can submit your first Storm topology.  We will use an example topology
from [storm-starter](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter) to run a first Storm topology
in the cluster.

First you will need to install [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/):

```shell
# Homebrew
$ brew install maven
# MacPorts
$ sudo port intall maven3
# sudo port select --set maven maven3
```

```shell
$ cd /tmp
# Clone Storm
$ git clone git://github.com/apache/storm.git
# Build Storm
$ cd storm
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

# Build the storm-starter example
$ cd examples/storm-starter
$ mvn compile exec:java -Dstorm.topology=storm.starter.WordCountTopology
$ mvn package
```

The last command `mvn package` will create a jar file of the storm-starter code at the following location:

    target/storm-starter-{version}-jar-with-dependencies.jar

We can now use this jar file to submit and run the `ExclamationTopology` in our Storm cluster.  But first we must make
this jar file available to the cluster machines.  To do so you must copy the jar file to the `shared/` folder on the
host machine.  This folder is mounted automatically in each virtual machine under `/shared` (note the leading slash).

_Note: The version number might be different for you, update the command to match. In the following examples we will use
version 0.9.3-SNAPSHOT._

```shell
# Run the following command on the host machine in the Wirbelsturm base directory
# (i.e. where Vagrantfile is)
$ cp /tmp/storm/examples/storm-starter/target/storm-starter-0.9.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar shared/
```

For this example we will submit the topology from the `nimbus1` machine.  That being said you can use any cluster
machine on which Storm is installed.

```shell
$ vagrant ssh nimbus1
[vagrant@nimbus1 ~]$ /opt/storm/bin/storm jar \
                        /shared/storm-starter-0.9.3-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
                        storm.starter.ExclamationTopology exclamation-topology
```

The `storm jar` command submits a topology to the cluster.  It instructs Storm to launch the `ExclamationTopology`
in distributed mode in the cluster.  Behind the scenes the storm-starter jar file is distributed by the Nimbus daemon
across the Storm slave nodes.

You can now open the Storm UI and check how your topology is doing:

* [http://localhost:28080/](http://localhost:28080/) -- Storm UI

To kill the topology either use the Storm UI or run the `storm` CLI tool:

```shell
$ /opt/storm/bin/storm kill exclamation-topology
```

# Credits

We want to thank the creators of [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Puppet](http://www.vagrantup.com/) in
particular, and also the open source community in general.  Wirbelsturm is only a thin integration layer between those
tools, and _none_ of the features that Wirbelsturm provides would be possible without those existing tools.  Many thanks
to all of you!
